a bit of AK style bolt recharge animation.

Late 2024 to 3/20/25:
//Pistol
- Enforcer Sidearm is now called the Vengeance Stryker Sidearm
- Pistol magazine count changed from 12 to 18.
- Pistol sprites completely revamped and overhauled, with newer sprites by TSF.
- Pistol animations have also been redone as well
- New sounds for the pistol
- Burst Fire is now a weapon special switch, similar to BD having it as an alt fire switch.
- Aim down the sights is alt fire for the Pistol.
- The Vengeance Striker tag name is slightly changed, to Vengeance Stryker.
- Burst Fire is now a weapon special switch, similar to BD having it as an alt fire switch.
- Alt Fire is now ADS.
- Reloading with Haste shows the normal reload animation.


//Deagle
- Deagle is now called the Shatterhand Pocket Cannon.
- Reload sounds tweaked
- New animations for firing, kicking, and reloading. 
- Reload animations are based on magazine count. Tactical reload is when you have more than one round 
   (which is a visual thing), A standard reload when exactly one round is left, and an empty reload if the 
   magazine is depleted.
- The reload animations will also be different if you have Haste. The normal reload animation is the 
default animation used for one or more rounds, but faster. 
The empty reload animation when you have Haste is the same as the normal one, 
but now has a chambering animation that is different. 
This is inspired by the Sleight of Hand perk in Call of Duty, particularly the recent versions 
from MW19 and later.
- Aim down the sights is the alt fire.
- Magazine count increased from 7 to 8 for the +1 in the chamber effect.
- Several sounds got minor edits. While still using Magmacow's sounds for reloading, 
portions of the MW19 Deagle reload sounds are mixed in.
- Deagle now takes away twice the amount of reserve ammo. 
Example: 7 Deagle rounds uses 14 pistol rounds. This is a balance change.
